# Object Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates an object detection system built using the OpenCV library in Python.

## Features
- Image Object Detection: Identifies and displays detected objects within still images.

- Video Object Detection: Processes video frames to detect objects in motion.

- Object Classification: Determines the category of each detected object (e.g., car, truck, bicycle, etc.).
