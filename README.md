Object Detection using OpenCV
This project demonstrates an object detection system built using the OpenCV library in Python.

Features
Image Object Detection: Identifies and displays detected objects within still images.

Video Object Detection: Processes video frames to detect objects in motion.

Object Classification: Determines the category of each detected object (e.g., car, truck, bicycle, etc.).

How to Run
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Visual Studio Code installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

<pre><code>
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
</code></pre>

Running the Code
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

Run the main script (typically main.py or Object_Detection.ipynb).
